\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

\subsection{Background}\label{bgd}
\paragraph*{}
Pairwise Relationship is a very common relationship in our daily life. We can use pairwise relationships to store many forms of data, including the relationship between friends, the connections between devices in a network. In reality, when we build the pairwise relationships, it is inevitable that some edges between nodes are absent in the graph, which might mislead others a lot. Therefore, finding a way to predict the edges between nodes is an important step, as it makes the graph much closer to the reality. However, it is not an easy task to find all missing edges in a graph, as we don't know the real relationships between nodes. 
\paragraph*{}
In this project, we have implemented a system to predict the pairwise relationships between nodes by using machine learning tools. Given the nodes and some edges in the graph, the system can predict whether there is an relationship between them. The results have shown that the machine learning model works well in predicting the edges between nodes. Although there are some errors, the model still performs quite well.

In this paper, the system implementation details will be deeply discussed. In section \ref{datafeature}, we will discuss the method of extract training data from given dataset and the process of feature engineering. In section \ref{appres}, the approaches we have used to design the system and their corresponding results will be mentioned. In addition, section \ref{analysis} will analyse the possible error in this system and the causes of these errors. Finally, section \ref{conclu} will make a conclusion and state the possible improvements of this system.



\section{Data Sampling and Feature Engineering}\label{datafeature}

\subsection{Data Sampling}\label{data}
\paragraph*{}
The original training data “train.txt” contains 20,000 records of user-follow from Twitter, with a total of 4,867,136 nodes(users). Due to oversized experimental data, in this experiment, we only randomly selected 50,000 edges (source node, target node) from the original data as the true edges (positive sample) of the experimental training data, and randomly selected 50,000 edges (source node, target node)  that do not exist in the original training data as the false edges (negative sample) of the experimental training data.

\section{Approaches and Results}\label{appres}
\paragraph*{}
After we sampled data from the entire dataset and conducted feature engineering, we tried to use different kinds of machine learning tools to generate the results, including logistic regression, random forest and deep learning.

\subsection{Logistic Regression}\label{lr}
\paragraph*{}
Logistic Regression is suitable for binary classification problem, which we have treated as a baseline for this system \citep{menard_lr}. We have divided the processed data into training set and validation test \citep{scikit-learn}. To prevent the model from overfitting, we have used validation set not only to tune hyperparameters, but also to see the performance of the model in a very different dataset. Based on the performance of the model in the validation set, we have chosen the hyperparameters with the greatest accuracy to train the data and make predictions. The performance of Logistic Regression model can be seen as follows:

\begin{table}[!htbp]

\caption{Logistic Regression Result}\label{tab:lr}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\toprule
Precision& Recall& F-1 Score\\
\midrule
0.99& 0.26& 0.41\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\paragraph*{}
From table \ref{tab:lr}, we can see that the logistic regression does not have a very good performance, but it is suitable to act as a baseline for this system.

\subsection{K-Nearest Neighbour}\label{knn}
\paragraph*{}
We have also used KNN classifier to try to improve the performance of the model \citep{Rebala2019}. Similar to what we have done in Logistic Regression, we have also divided the data into training set and validation set. By using scikit-learn tools \citep{scikit-learn}, we can train the model and predict the results more easily. Table \ref{tab:knn} has shown the results of K-Nearest Neighbour model. It is evident that KNN performs a little bit better than Logistic Regression, as the F-1 score is much higher. However, we still need to use some more powerful models to enhance the performance even further.
